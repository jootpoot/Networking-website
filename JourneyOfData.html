                        <p>
                            When a link is clicked, information is broken up into pieces 
                            and placed into a packet along with details about the sender, 
                            recipient, and type of packet. This packet is called a data 
                            packet. Each packet then moves through the network in a series of
                            hops.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After getting packaged and labeled,
                            the packet then enters your Local area Network (LAN). This
                            network is a small network that connect all local computers,
                            printers, routers etc. However, this network isn't very secured
                            resulting in accidents taking place - accidents such as losing 
                            data and etc.

                        <h2>3. Router</h2>
                        <p>
                            If the router detects an address, it will reroute the packet 
                            onto a different network, acting like a traffic officer on a 
                            disorganized highway.

                        <h2>4. Router Switch</h2>
                        <p>
                            The packets enter the corporate intranet when they leave the 
                            router and travel to the router switch. While a router switch 
                            is similar to a router, it is slightly more efficient.

                        <h2>5. Proxy</h2>
                        <p>
                            The proxy then examines the packets and looks for the URL. 
                            Many businesses use proxies to boost security while reducing 
                            the strain on their internet connection. The packet moves on 
                            to the Firewall at the following stage 
                            if everything checks okay. A URL is deleted and the sender 
                            encounters an error if it does not comply to a company's rules 
                            or is invalid.
